# Common types of branches based on their function are:
1. Main Branch: 
   - This is the primary branch of a repository
   - Typically contains official project history and the most recent stable or production-ready code. 
   - New repositories often default to naming this branch main or master.
2. Develop Branch: 
   - Used in workflows like GitFlow
   - Serves as an integration branch for ongoing development. 
   - Feature and bugfix branches are often created from develop and merged back into it.
   - **Naming Convention:** `develop/description-of-feature`
3. Feature Branches: 
   - Developers create these branches to work on a new feature in isolation. 
   - They are usually short-lived 
   - Feature branches are merged back into the develop or main branch once the feature is complete, tested, and reviewed.
   - Deleted once purpose is achieved
   - **Naming Convention:** `feature/description-of-feature`
4. Bugfix Branches: 
   - Used to specifically track and fix bugs that are part of the next scheduled release cycle. 
   - Semantically, they differ from feature branches but are handled in a similar way within the workflow.
   - **Naming Convention:** `bugfix/issue-id-description`
5. Hotfix Branches: 
   - These are short-lived branches created to quickly address critical bugs discovered in the production code that require immediate attention.
   - They are typically branched directly off the main branch 
   - Merged back into both main and develop (or the relevant active development branch) once the fix is verified.
   - **Naming Convention:** `hotfix/critical-issue-id`
6. Release Branches: 
   - Created when the develop branch is nearly ready for a new software version release
   - Used for final preparations. 
   - Tasks within a release branch involve:
     - bumping version numbers
     - fixing minor release-specific bugs
     - general housekeeping before the branch is merged into main and then back into develop. 
   - **Naming Convention:** `release/v1.0.0`
