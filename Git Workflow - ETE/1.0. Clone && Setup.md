9. Sync Local:
    - Switch to main: `git switch main`
    - Review First: `git fetch origin main`, review, `git merge` OR
    - Quick Sync: `git pull origin main`
10. Post-merge Cleanup:
    - Delete merged remote `git push origin --delete <feature/feature-name>`
    - Delete merged local `git branch -d <feature/feature-name>` (or `-D` if needed)
    - Prune stale references `git remote prune origin`

#### One-Liner Delete
1. Delete local branches merged into current, excluding 'main' and current branch
```bash
`git branch --merged \| Where-Object { $_ -notmatch '^\*' -and $_ -notmatch 'main' } \| ForEach-Object { git branch -d $_.Trim() }`
```
2. Identify and delete merged remote-tracking branches (local refs only)
```bash 
`git branch -r --merged \| Select-String 'origin/' \| ForEach-Object { git branch -rd $_.ToString().Trim() }`
```
