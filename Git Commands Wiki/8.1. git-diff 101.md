# git diff
**`git diff` shows the exact line-by-line changes between different states of your repository — for example, between your working directory, staging area, and commits. It’s the go-to command for reviewing what has changed before staging or committing.**
⚠️ Always check both git diff and git diff --cached before committing to avoid surprises

## 🔍 What `git diff` Does
- **Compares changes** between:
    - Working directory ↔ Staging area (unstaged changes).
    - Staging area ↔ Last commit (staged but not committed).
    - Two commits, branches, or tags.
- **Outputs differences** in a unified diff format:
    - `-` lines show deletions.
    - `+` lines show additions.
- Helps you **review changes before committing**, ensuring accuracy.

## ⚙️ Common Usage Examples

| Command                        | What It Shows                            | When to Use                                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `git diff`                     | WD vs staging area (unstaged changes).   | Check what you’ve modified but not yet staged. |
| `git diff --cached`            | Staging vs last commit (staged changes). | Review what will be committed next.            |
| `git diff HEAD`                | Working + Staged changes vs last commit. | Quick overview of everything changed locally.  |
| `git diff <commit1> <commit2>` | Differences between two commits.         | Compare history or review pull requests.       |
| `git diff branchA..branchB`    | Differences between branches.            | See what would change if you merged.           |
| `git diff -- <file>`           | Changes in a specific file.              | Narrow focus to one file.                      |


| Command                        | What It Shows                                                      |

## 🛠️ Practical Workflow
1. **Edit files** → make changes in your working directory.
2. Run `git diff` || `git diff --stat` || `git diff --color` (colourised output)  → see unstaged changes.
3. Run `git add <file>` → stage changes.
4. Run `git diff --cached` → confirm staged changes.
5. Run `git commit -m "message"` → commit confidently.

## ⚠️ Key Considerations
- **Output can be verbose**: Use flags like `--stat` for a summary (file names + line counts).
- **Binary files**: `git diff` won’t show meaningful diffs for binaries.
- **Colorized output**: Use `git diff --color` for readability.
- **Risk of missing changes**: Always check both `git diff` and `git diff --cached` before committing to avoid surprises.

✅ **Tip for you, Karabo** (since you’re detail-oriented in code review):  
You can combine `git diff --stat` with `git diff` to first get a summary, then dive into specific files. This makes execution tracing and review much more efficient when teaching or documenting workflows.

Would you like me to also create a **visual ASCII-style diagram** showing how `git diff` compares the three Git states (Working Directory, Staging Area, HEAD)? It’s a great teaching tool for onboarding guides.
