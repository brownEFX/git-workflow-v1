## Understanding the git diff Output
- The output of git diff follows a standard format:
  - --- a/file and +++ b/file: These lines are a legend. 
    - The --- indicates the "original" or "before" version (version a), and +++ indicates the "new" or "after" version (version b).
  - @@ ... @@: The chunk header shows which lines in the file have changes. 
    - For example, @@ -1,8 +1,7 @@ means 6 lines were extracted starting from line 34 in the old file, and 8 lines were added starting at line 34 in the new file.
  - Lines prefixed with - (red): Content that was removed from the old file.
  - Lines prefixed with + (green): Content that was added in the new file.
  - For a visual alternative, you can configure and use git difftool to open
