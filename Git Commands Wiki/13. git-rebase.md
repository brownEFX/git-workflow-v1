# git rebase
- git rebase is used to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving 
- It is also used for combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
- Unlike git merge, which creates a merge commit, rebase rewrites the project's commit history to create a clean, linear history.

## How Git Rebase Works
When you rebase a feature branch onto a main branch, Git does the following:
1. It temporarily undoes the commits on your current branch that are not on the base branch.
2. It applies the latest commits from the base branch (e.g., main).
3. It reapplies your branch's commits one by one on top of the base branch's latest commit.
- The end result is that your feature branch appears as if it was created from the most current point of the main branch.
