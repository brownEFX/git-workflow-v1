### Basic Usage
The most common way to use the command is:
```bash
git push <remote> <branch> e.g. git push origin feature/login
```
- default remote name is origin,
- the main branch is often named main (or master in older repositories).

git push origin main
Common Variations and Options
git push (without arguments): If your current local branch has an "upstream" branch configured (a link to a specific remote branch), running git push by itself will push to that linked branch.
git push -u origin <branch>: This is a crucial command used when pushing a new branch for the first time. The -u (or --set-upstream) flag links your local branch to the remote branch of the same name. After using this once, you can simply use git push for future updates from that branch.
git push --all: This pushes all of your local branches to the remote repository.
git push --tags: Tags are not automatically pushed with branches; this command explicitly sends all your local tags to the remote.
git push --force (or -f): This overrides Git's safety checks, forcing the remote repository to match your local history, even if it means overwriting others' work or losing history on the remote. Use with extreme caution.
git push --force-with-lease: A safer alternative to --force that only force-pushes if no one else has added new commits to the remote branch since you last fetched.
Before You Push
As a best practice, you should always run git pull (or git fetch followed by git merge) before pushing to incorporate any changes made by other collaborators into your local repository. This helps you resolve potential merge conflicts locally rather than on the remote serve
